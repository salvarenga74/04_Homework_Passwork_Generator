## Task and Expectation
In this assignment I was expected to render an existing code to create a tool that would generate a randomized password using the user given parameters.

The User is expected:
* To be able to load my deployment page 
* To be able to input how long they want the password to be 
* Have the option to  include special characters, numbers, lower case letters and/or upper case letter.
* Choose password length to be a minimum of 8 characters long 
* Password length to be more than 128 characters long.


## Results

I met the accepted criteria of this assignment and have gone written a beautiful js script page (in my opinion). I have taken care that all of my code follows a logical path and is easy to read and understand the purpose for the sections of code according to use.

My password generator collects user input for all the required fields and stores the values to be used throughout the code. I also have parameters that ensure the inputs meet the requirements in terms of length.  

The password generator uses utilizes functions for random number in combination to arrays to create new randomized arrays. This tool also utilized a for loop to create a completed random password.
